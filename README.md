Short description:
Add-on for Blender to connect rigid bodies via constraints in a physical plausible way.


Project description:
The Finnish Laurea University of Applied Sciences is taking part in an EU funded project, named Inachus. The project in general examines measures to improve the first response in case of catastrophic events like earthquakes or explosions etc. A particular part of this project is the simulation of the effects that catastrophic events have on built structures. Within the three year lasting project Laurea researches the application of the discrete element method DEM to virtually simulate collapsing building structures. The DEM approach will be compared with the finite element method FEM and the applied element method AEM.

Add-on for Blender: 
We are developing an add-on that complements the bullet physics engine in Blender. The add-on will allow to attribute realistic structural dependencies between building elements such as pillars, walls, beams, slabs etc. The tool set in conjunction with the bullet physics engine should deliver satisfactory simulation results. Kai Kostack and Martin Felke have for many years laid a solid ground work for the current development. 
Kai Kostack has now finished a first script version that automatically sets multiple constraint to enable several force evaluations on precise junction points between rigid objects. The script also automatically calculates the breaking threshold values for each of the constraints based on material properties.

Expectations:
We expect, that we will be able to simulate failing building structures under hazardous impact to a degree that allows predictions, what building parts will resist the impact and where falling debris will accumulate. In a best case scenario the simulation will indicate where spatial pockets will be likely to be formed, that allow victims to survive.
